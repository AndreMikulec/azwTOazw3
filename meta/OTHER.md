## Critical Warning

    1. The person who is converting the book(s) from the .az3 format to the .azw format
       MUST OWN the books. This most often means PAID MONEY TO OWN THE BOOK(S).
    2. The output books producted by this build MUST BE USED as input or knowledge,
       as an `intermediate step`, to produce the `end product` open source software.
       An example may be a book on the top of "CI/CD pipelines".

## Instructions

### In the Local user desktop, Manually Go and Do

    1. Git clone this repository `azwTOazw3` to a local location
    2. If not done already, go to https://www.appveyor.com/
       and choose the button `CREATE YOUR FREE ACCOUNT NOW`
       or chooe the URL link `Sign in` as appropriate.
       BE SURE TO associate your Appveyor account with Github. 
       (I am not showing "how to associate".)
       Remember one's username: USERNAME.
    3. In Appveyor, add this repository as a Project
       https://ci.appveyor.com/projects -> (*) New Project -> 
       Github -> Select repository for your new project -> `azwTOazw3` 
    4. On one's home computer, change the directory 
       to be in the local git repository -> `cd azwTOazw3`
    5. echo #### >> README.md
    6. git commit -m "touch"
    7. git push -u origin master (or git push -u main)
    8. Find one's Amazon `logon` and `password` and have it handy
    9. Windows -> Start -> Type this -> `rdp` 
    (Appearing will be a small window called `Remote Desktop Connections`)
    10. Browse to the URL 
        (and change USERNAME to one's USERNAME): `https://ci.appveyor.com/project/USERNAME/azwtoazw3`
    11. From the blue output, and near the bottom, collect the Server (and port) and Username.
        One is looking for something like this (and your IP:Port will be different):
        ```
        Remote Desktop connection details:
          Server: 67.225.165.215:33829 (This is IP:Port)
          Username: appveyor           (This is Username)
        ```
    12. In the `Remote Desktop Connections` window.
        In `Computer` enter the `Server` IP:Port.
        In the lower left find `Show Options` and to it's right, click on the `down arrow`
    13. In `User name` enter the Username (This is often `appveyor`.) 
    14. Press the button `Connect`
    15. In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog of "Certificate errors warning" 
        press the button`Yes`.
    16. In the "Enter your credentials" small window, at the password prompt, 
        enter the password from the appveyor.yml environment section 
        variable `APPVEYOR_RDP_PASSWORD`

### In the Appveyor desktop, Manually Go and Do

(in the future I would HIGHLY prefer to use AutoIt or similar software automate SOME of this)

    1. On the Windows Desktop on the left side, click the icon "Kindle"
       or, alternately, do Windows -> Start -> (near the top) Recently Added -> Kindle
    2. Kindle -> Tools -> Options -> 
       TURN OFF: [ ] Automatically install updates when they are available without asking me.
       Press the button `Save`.
    3. Kindle -> Tools -> Sync and Check for New Items, the "Register Kindle" window appears
       Enter one's Amazon `login`.
       Enter one's Amazon `password`.
       At the bottom, press the big yellow button `Connect using Secure Server`
    4. Authentication also occur externally, e.g. a text message of verification.
       Perform that external verification.
       At the end of that verification, return here.
       Close (x" out of) that window.
       Redo Step (2).
    5. In the Kindle GUI, below the word "Library", make sure "All" is highlighted.
       In "Library All" display area, of each the book(s) of interest, 
       and one at at at time. Right click and choose `Download`.
       As each is "Right clicked Download(ed)", 
       notice the "check, in each book in the lower left corner.
       At the end of all "Right clicked Download(ed)"s 
       notice, on the left side, "Downloaded 0" changes to Downloaded #".
       (If no book(s) or one's `book(s) of interest` IS\ARE NOT SEEN,
        5.1 then, using Google Chrome, browse to the URL: https://www.amazon.com, 
        5.2 then, login with one's Amazon `login` and `password`,
        5.3 then, go to the top corner, see `Hello USERNAME Account & Lists` and click on it,
        5.4 then, hover over those words, move the mouse down to the words, 
            `Content & Devices`, then click
        5.5 then, on the new page, near the middle left side, click on the `Books` icon
        5.6 then, for EACH BOOK OF INTEREST, one at a time,
        5.7 then, in the left column, place a checkmark next to that book,
        5.8 then, in the page button bar (up near the top), 
            this button will become enabled `Deliver to Device`
        5.9 then, click `Deliver to Device`
        5.10 then, in the `Deliver to Device` click the obvious `[x] Username's Kindle for PC #`
        5.11 then, if the the solution is NOT OBVIOUS, 
             then click on ALL of the `[x] Username's Kindle for PC #`
        5.12 then, if limited by the message `Cannot select more than 6 devices`, 
             then perhaps? choose the highest PC # numbers. or
             then perhaps? remove some/all PC # numbers (because too many).
        5.13 then, (near the bottom), press the yellow button `Make Changes`
        5.14 then, on the message box `Request to deliver title(s) has been sent` 
             in the  URL _pending_request_, 
             right click and choose `Open link in new tab`
        5.15 then, manually return to the previous (pre-the-right-click) web page.
        5.16 then, close that small message box (press the `upper-right corner 'x'`)
        5.17 then, then REPEAT upon the NEXT BOOK OF INTEREST)
    6. From step 5, if one had to add book(s) to the `"Library All" display area`, 
       in the Kindle GUI of `"Library All" display area`, to its upper right and across 
       and right from the word `Library`press the `circular pointing arrows icon` 
       and this will refresh the book(s) 
    7. If not already done, In the Kindle GUI `"Library All" display area`, 
       of each the book(s) of interest, and one at at at time. 
       Right click and choose Download.
       As each is "Right clicked Download(ed)", notice the 
       "check, in each book in the lower left corner.
       At the end of all "Right clicked Download(ed)"s 
       notice, on the left side, "Downloaded 0" changes to Downloaded #".
    8. Verify, the book(s) are downloaded.
       Windows -> Start -> Command Prompt -> 
       Type this -> `dir "%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Documents\My Kindle Content"`
       The number of `.azw` files seen, must(should) match the number of book(s) downloaded.
    9. Kindle -> File -> Exit
    10. On the [upper right are of the] desktop, select the icon `Delete me to continue build`.
        Right click and choose Delete. 
        !!! THIS `DELETE ICON` IS REQUIRED TO EXIT THE APPVEYOR DESKTOP !!! 
        The Appveyor build continues and finishes.

### In the Local user desktop, Manually Go and Do
     
    1. After the build is done, on one's local computer, 
       collect the artifacts (that contains the .azw3 files),
       by browsing to the URL (and change USERNAME to one's USERNAME) 
       https://ci.appveyor.com/project/USERNAME/azwtoazw3/build/artifacts
    2. Download the books.7z file artifact
    3. On that same web page, DELETE THAT artifact
    4. On the local desktop use 7-zip to extract 
       from the books.7z folders and files, the new .awz3 files
    5. Use Calibre (or other software), to read those .awz3 files

Books published after January 3, 2023 
cannot be downloaded using earlier versions (1.26 and prior) of Kindle for PC.
While the newest version (1.39) of Kindle for PC will download them, 
it will be in a version of KFX that DeDRM cannot break.
Except for books only available as KFX, 
books published before January 3 are still currently able to be downloaded 
in a format that can be DeDRM'd.
Books borrowed from Kindle Unlimited can still be downloaded 
on K4PC <1.26 if it was published before January 3.

Download and Transfer

If you have an e-Ink Kindle, "Download and Transfer" is still available for purchased books, 
regardless of when they were published. 
The DRM can be removed from these files using the DeDRM plugin.
However, books borrowed from Kindle Unlimited are not eligible for Download & Transfer.

Check if the books are available on other websites that offer DRM-free 
or more easily-removed ADE (Adobe Digital Editions) DRM:

Important update: Amazon has made a change to their service 
so the books published since Jan 3 2023 can no longer be downloaded
 using Kindle for PC or Mac versions prior to 1.39. 
(Details in this thread.) 
This means that methods 1, 2, and 4 described below are no longer effective for those books. 
Methods 3 and 5 still work. 
There is also a new method (#6) using an old version of the Kindle for Android app described here.

Methods 3 and 5 . . .
```

Method 3 - Use an e-ink Kindle instead 
https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=283371
```
BUY PHYSICAL HARDWARE: the e-ink Kindle.

Import the downloaded file into calibre using the same procedure 
that you would use for a file from Kindle for PC.

Note that Download & Transfer is not available for every book. 
Books borrowed through Kindle Unlimited or Prime Lending do not have this option. 
And there are other miscellaneous categories of books where this is unavailable.

Enable developer mode on your Android device. 
Connect your device to your computer with a USB cable.
Open up a command line (Terminal on Mac OS X and cmd.exe on Windows) 
adb backup com.amazon.kindle
(A file "backup.ab" should be created in your home directory.)

3. After downloading your book
```
Look in /Android/data/com.amazon.kindle/files/ 
for PRC files inside ASIN-labelled subfolders. Copy it out and DeDRM it.
