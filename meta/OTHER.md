This repository not based on the following.
But future considerations are given to the following:

DeDRM tools for ebooks
This is a fork of Apprentice Harper's version of the DeDRM tools.

The following does not affect the Appveyour build, 
because a brand new machine is created upon each build:
```
Noted, if using Kindle manually and trying to login using the 
step `Kindle ->  Tools -> Sync and Check for New Items`
and if the following error is occurring and re-occurring and re-occurring, 
`enter a valid email or mobile number`

## Critical Warning

  1. The person who is converting the book(s) from the .az3 format to the .azw format
     MUST OWN the books. This most often means PAID MONEY TO OWN THE BOOK(S).
  2. The output books producted by this build MUST BE USED as input or knowledge,
     as an `intermediate step`, to produce the `end product` open source software.
     An example may be a book on the top of "CI/CD pipelines".

## Instructions

### In the Local user desktop, Manually Go and Do

  1. Git clone this repository `azwTOazw3` to a local location
  2. If not done already, go to https://www.appveyor.com/
     and choose the button `CREATE YOUR FREE ACCOUNT NOW`
     or chooe the URL link `Sign in` as appropriate.
     BE SURE TO associate your Appveyor account with Github. 
     (I am not showing "how to associate".)
     Remember one's username: USERNAME.
  3. In Appveyor, add this repository as a Project
     https://ci.appveyor.com/projects -> (*) New Project -> 
     Github -> Select repository for your new project -> `azwTOazw3` 
  4. On one's home computer, change the directory 
     to be in the local git repository -> `cd azwTOazw3`

  8. Find one's Amazon `logon` and `password` and have it handy
  9. Windows -> Start -> Type this -> `rdp` 
  (Appearing will be a small window called `Remote Desktop Connections`)
  10. Browse to the URL (and change USERNAME to one's USERNAME): `https://ci.appveyor.com/project/USERNAME/azwtoazw3`
  11. From the blue output, and near the bottom, collect the Server (and port) and Username.
      One is looking for something like this (and your IP:Port will be different):
      ```
      Remote Desktop connection details:
        Server: 67.225.165.215:33829 (This is IP:Port)
        Username: appveyor           (This is Username)
      ```
  12. In the `Remote Desktop Connections` window.
      In `Computer` enter the `Server` IP:Port.
      In the lower left find `Show Options` and to it's right, click on the `down arrow`
  13. In `User name` enter the Username (This is often `appveyor`.) 
  14. Press the button `Connect`
  15. In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog of "Certificate errors warning" press the button`Yes`
  16. In the "Enter your credentials" small window, at the password prompt, enter the password 
      from the appveyor.yml environment section variable `APPVEYOR_RDP_PASSWORD`

### In the Appveyor desktop, Manually Go and Do

(in the future I would HIGHLY prefer to use AutoIt or similar software automate SOME of this)

  1. On the Windows Desktop on the left side, click the icon "Kindle"
     or, alternately, do Windows -> Start -> (near the top) Recently Added -> Kindle
  2. Kindle -> Tools -> Options -> 
     TURN OFF: [ ] Automatically install updates when they are available without asking me.
     Press the button `Save`.
  3. Kindle -> Tools -> Sync and Check for New Items, the "Register Kindle" window appears
     Enter one's Amazon `login`.
     Enter one's Amazon `password`.
     At the bottom, press the big yellow button `Connect using Secure Server`
  4. Authentication also occur externally, e.g. a text message of verification.
     Perform that external verification.
     At the end of that verification, return here.
     Close (x" out of) that window.
     Redo Step (2).
  5. In the Kindle GUI, below the word "Library", make sure "All" is highlighted.
     In "Library All" display area, of each the book(s) of interest, 
     and one at at at time. Right click and choose `Download`.
     As each is "Right clicked Download(ed)", notice the "check, in each book in the lower left corner.
     At the end of all "Right clicked Download(ed)"s 
     notice, on the left side, "Downloaded 0" changes to Downloaded #".
     (If no book(s) or one's `book(s) of interest` IS\ARE NOT SEEN,
     5.1 then, using Google Chrome, browse to the URL: https://www.amazon.com, 
     5.2 then, login with one's Amazon `login` and `password`,
     5.3 then, go to the top corner, see `Hello USERNAME Account & Lists` and click on it,
     5.4 then, hover over those words, move the mouse down to the words, `Content & Devices`, then click
     5.5 then, on the new page, near the middle left side, click on the `Books` icon
     5.6 then, for EACH BOOK OF INTEREST, one at a time,
     5.7 then, in the left column, place a checkmark next to that book,
     5.8 then, in the page button bar (up near the top), this button will become enabled `Deliver to Device`
     5.9 then, click `Deliver to Device`
     5.10 then, in the `Deliver to Device` click the obvious `[x] Username's Kindle for PC #`
     5.11 then, if the the solution is NOT OBVIOUS, then click on ALL of the `[x] Username's Kindle for PC #`
     5.12 then, if limited by the message `Cannot select more than 6 devices`, then perhaps? choose the highest PC # numbers.
     5.13 then, (near the bottom), press the yellow button `Make Changes`
     5.14 then, on the message box `Request to deliver title(s) has been sent` in the  URL _pending_request_, 
          right click and choose `Open link in new tab`
     5.15 then, manually return to the previous (pre-the-right-click) web page.
     5.16 then, close that small message box (press the `upper-right corner 'x'`)
     5.17 then, then REPEAT upon the NEXT BOOK OF INTEREST)
  6. From step 5, if one had to add book(s) to the `"Library All" display area`, 
     in the Kindle GUI of `"Library All" display area`, to its upper right and across 
     and right from the word `Library`press the `circular pointing arrows icon` and this will refresh the book(s) 
  7. If not already done, In the Kindle GUI `"Library All" display area`, 
     of each the book(s) of interest, and one at at at time. Right click and choose Download.
     As each is "Right clicked Download(ed)", notice the "check, in each book in the lower left corner.
     At the end of all "Right clicked Download(ed)"s 
     notice, on the left side, "Downloaded 0" changes to Downloaded #".
  8. Verify, the book(s) are downloaded.
     Windows -> Start -> Command Prompt -> 
     Type this -> `dir "%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Documents\My Kindle Content"`
     The number of `.azw` files seen, must(should) match the number of book(s) downloaded.
  9. Kindle -> File -> Exit
  10. On the [upper right are of the] desktop, select the icon `Delete me to continue build`.
      Right click and choose Delete. !!! THIS `DELETE ICON` IS REQUIRED TO EXIT THE APPVEYOR DESKTOP !!! 
      The Appveyor build continues and finishes.

### In the Local user desktop, Manually Go and Do
     
  1. After the build is done, on one's local computer, collect the artifacts (that contains the .azw3 files),
     by browsing to the URL (and change USERNAME to one's USERNAME) 
     https://ci.appveyor.com/project/USERNAME/azwtoazw3/build/artifacts
  2. Download the books.7z file artifact
  3. On that same web page, DELETE THAT artifact
  4. On the local desktop use 7-zip to extract 
     from the books.7z folders and files, the new .awz3 files
  5. Use Calibre (or other software), to read those .awz3 files
